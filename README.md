### Find a suitable music API
After lots of consideration, it looks like I'll be using [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/us/) as the API for this project. We might be limited to 30second songs but I think this will lead to an overall fun Next.js project.

### Functionality wants/needs
- oAuth Login
- Create Playlist
- Favorites
- Search Bar
- Music Player
- Mobile Responsiveness (how in the world will this look on mobile o.0)
